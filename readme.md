# ðŸŒŸ Image Carousel

A simple and accessible image carousel implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This carousel allows users to navigate through images using previous/next buttons or by selecting navigation dots.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Responsive and accessible design
- Supports navigation via buttons and dots
- Smooth slide transitions
- ARIA attributes for better accessibility
- Easy to customize and extend
- Toggling autoplay for window resizing, touch device users, keyboard users, mouse users
- implement lazy loading with loading="lazy" for performance.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Approach :-

##### 1.HTML Structure :

- start with a container div with class "carousel" wraps the entire carousel.
- A div with class "carousel\_\_navdots home-page" section for dot indicators.
- Navigation buttons (.prev, .next) allow users to manually switch slides.
- Each slide has an "img" inside a "div" with class="carousel\_\_slide".
- Navigation dots (button) allow users to jump between slides.
- role="group" tells screen readers that its child elements constitute a single slide as a whole.
- aria-label identifies each slide.
- aria - roledescription="slide" tells screen readers that the "div" element is a slide.
- aria-label tells screen readers that what purpose this group of buttons serves for.

##### 2. CSS for Styling and Animations: :

- Makes the carousel full-width.
- Adds padding to accommodate navigation dots.
- Uses flexbox to arrange slides in a row.
- Implements scroll-snap for smooth scrolling.
- Hides the scrollbar for a clean UI.
- Images scale properly with object-fit: cover.
- Positioned at the bottom for easy navigation.
- Buttons update dynamically using the .is-active class.
- Rounded buttons with hover effects.

##### 3. JavaScript Logic :

- first collect the components of the carousel.
- total_Slides is simply the number of slides in the carousel.
- total_slidesCloned will play a crucial role when we make the carousel infinitely-scrolling.
- slideWidth, is the width of each slide.
- spaceBtwSlides, is the width of whitespace between the pair of slides next to each other.
- index_slideCurrent() computes the index of the slide currently shown from how much the slide wrapper is scrolled.
- attached a click event handler to each navigation dot, handleNavDotPositionSlide function handles scroll the slide to particular position.
- markNavdot function applies the .is-activeclass to a navigation dot with the given index.
- updateNavdot function that runs markNavdot() for the one corresponding to the currently shown slide.
- used a scroll event handler to execute the updateNavdot() function, Every time the user scrolls the carousel, the scroll event fires, removing the is-active class from all the navigation dots and marking the one that corresponds to the current slide.
- for infinite scrolling behaviour attaches the cloned first slide as the last in the series of slides.
- Implemented rewindScroll() function and forwardScroll() function for scrolling the carousel.
- created a function to start autoplaying the carousel with the use of setInterval():
- for autoplay, playCarouselSlide(), stopCarouselSlide() functions has been implemented.
- IntersectionObserver features added for to start autoplay is when the carousel fully enters into the userâ€™s viewport. It doesnâ€™t make sense to autoplay the carousel when itâ€™s not shown entirely to the user, autoplay should stop when part of the carousel goes outside the viewport.
- used pointerenter and pointerleave event listeners and attach them to the carousel container.
- keyboard users autoplay is used focus and blur event listeners.
- touchstart event fires whenever the user touches the carousel, in which case autoplay stops.

### 2. Design Choices

#### Responsiveness

- Used max-width: 800px and width: 80vw for a flexible layout.
- Applied object-fit: cover to ensure images scale properly.
- set the resize event handler to keep slideWidth and spaceBtwSlides updated.

#### Smooth Animations

- Navigation buttons have hover effects to improve UX.
- Dot indicators change color smoothly.
  User Experience Enhancements
- Infinite looping ensures smooth cycling of images.
- Keyboard navigation for accessibility.
- Touch support improves mobile usability.

### 3. Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. Lazy Loading Implementation

- Initially, images loaded all at once, increasing load time.
- Used the IntersectionObserver API to load images only when they are about to be visible.

#### 2. Handling Infinite Looping

- Initially, translating the slides caused a sudden jump when transitioning from the last image to the first.
- Duplicating slides, attaches the cloned first slide as the last in the series of slides and cloned last slide as the first in the series of slides.

#### 3. Preventing Autoplay Conflicts

- The autoplay function was conflicting with manual navigation.
- Stopped autoplay when a user interacts (clicks/swipes) and restarted it after inactivity.

#### 4. Touch Swipe Gestures

- Detecting swipe direction on mobile was challenging.
- add "touchstart" event listner and stop autoplay.

#### 5. Togging autoplay for keyboard users

- used focus and blur event listeners.
- option "true" is necessary to catch the focus/blur event fired by any element inside the carousel container.

### 4. Extra Features Implemented

#### âœ… Lazy Loading

- Improves performance by only loading images when they are about to appear.

#### âœ… Autoplay with Stop on Interaction

- Autoplay runs every 2.5 seconds but stops if the user interacts.

#### âœ… Infinite Loop

- Ensures the transition from last to first slide is seamless.

#### âœ… Touch Swipe for Mobile

- Users can swipe left/right to change slides.
